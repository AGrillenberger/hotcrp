<h1 style="text-align: center">Reviewing Standards for CGO 2004</h1>

<p>


<p>

Reviewers often do not completely agree on a submission, so the detailed evaluation of the merits and 
deficiencies of a paper need to be summarized in the review. If you like the paper immensely, 
do not assume other reviewers 
will feel the same way. Describe in detail what you think is important about it and how it will 
contribute to theory or practice. If you are sure the paper should be rejected, you should explain 
why, <b> politely </b>, but in detail, because other reviewers may recommend acceptance.  Even if the paper 
is not accepted, 
the work may be published elsewhere, and the authors will still benefit from your constructive suggestions. 

<p>

<b>
The tone of your review is important. When you write an anonymous review, 
you are acting as a representative of our field. It is <em> always </em>possible 
to be constructive. 
</b>
<p>


<p style="text-align: left">Papers submitted to CGO are expected to be 
original, innovative works. Papers should be no longer than 22 pages 
using 1.5 line spacing.  Please see
the 
<a href="http://www.cgo.org/html/submission.html">
following for the specific instructions given to authors on how to submit their paper blind.
</a>

</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The review process consists of four steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">You should read the paper and enter your review 
  information. You can continue to return and edit your review information until 
  the end of the review period, as long as you have not &quot;finalized&quot; it.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">When you are done with your review &quot;finalize&quot; it 
  using the first menu selection, labeled &quot;Are you done with your review&quot;.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">When all reviews are finished, authors will be 
  able to read the two sections labeled &quot;Comments to be addressed in the rebuttal
and Additional detailed comments to the author&quot;. They will then be 
  able to respond to those comments. That is the <i>only</i> information that 
  authors will see.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">During program committee meeting, PC members will 
  use all the review information and the information provided by the author to 
  select papers for the conference.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left">When you review a paper, there are several things 
you need to tell us. This list follows the list of questions on the review form. 
When you change an entry on the form, you need to click the button labeled &quot;<b>Submit 
your paper review</b>&quot;. If you leave the page without clicking that button, your 
review entry will not be stored.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;<b>Are you finished with this review?<br>
  </b>Once you &quot;finalize&quot; this review, you can not modify it any further. Be 
  careful with this option.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;<b>Provide a short summary of the paper<br>
  </b>You should briefly summarize the paper.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;<b>Strength of Paper<br> </b>
  Summarize in 1 to 3 sentences the strengths of the paper.  You
  should be able to find at least some strength (positive point) in <b> every </b>
  paper.
  </li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;<b>Weakness of Paper<br> </b>
  Summarize in 1 to 3 sentences the main weakness of the paper.
  </li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;<b>Your qualifications to review this paper<br>
  </b>We realize that not all reviewers are equally qualified; accurately 
  assessing your background will help the program committee understand your 
  review.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;<b>Writing<br>
  </b>Is the paper readable? If there are &quot;show stopper&quot; issues, you should 
  inform the program committee.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;<b>Relevance to CGO<br>
  </b>Do you think the paper would engender a lot of discussion? Do you think 
  the average attendee would attend the paper presentation?</li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;<b>Experimental Methodology<br>
  </b>Was the experimental method reasonable? Good benchmarks? Good assumptions?</li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;<b>Novelty of paper<br>
  </b>This conference focuses on novel work; it's acceptable that a novel idea 
  have slightly less stringent evaluation than an incremental improvement, so we 
  need to know how novel the work is. If you think the paper is <b><i>not</i></b> 
  novel, you should clearly state why and indicate related prior work in your 
  comments to the author or program committee.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left"><b>&nbsp;Overall paper merit<br>
  </b>This is the single most important decision concerning the paper - do you 
  think it should be accepted to the conference? If you think the paper should 
  be a short paper, you <b><i>must</i></b> indicate that it would be an 
  acceptable short paper and you should leave a comment to the program committee
  to that effect.</P>
<DL>
<DT>1) Reject -</DT><DD> Paper is not of interest to CGO, it has already been
done, or has serious methodology flaws.</DD>

<DT>2) Weak Reject -</DT><DD> Paper is potentially of interest to CGO, and has
some value in the ideas presented, but it has either potential
methodology issues or it is a borderline incremental/already been done
contribution.</DD>

<DT>3) Weak Accept -</DT><DD> Paper is of interest to CGO, and is an incremental
contribution paper with average/weak methodology.</DD>

with average/weak methodology, or incremental contribution paper that
has good methodology.</DD>

<DT>5) Strong Accept -</DT><DD> This is of interest to CGO, and a novel or new
contribution to existing area with good/average methodology, or an
incremental contribution paper that has excellent methodology.</DD>

<DT>6) Definite accept -</DT><DD> This is of interest to CGO, and a novel or new
contribution to existing area with excellent/good methodology.</DD>

  <p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;<b>Comments for the authors to address in the rebuttal <br>
  </b>
  These are the comments the authors will concentrate on responding to in their
  rebuttal.  If there are any important questions that need to be answered or you
  believe there are major issues with the paper, these all need to be raised here
  for the authors to address.
</li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;<b>Additional detailed comments to the author<br>
  </b>This is the single most important response you can provide to the author. 
  One of the critical roles of a review process is to help authors understand 
  any problems with their work so they can improve it. Please spend the time to 
  indicate to the author and program committee <b><i>&nbsp;why</i></b> you've 
  rated the paper the way you did.</li>
  <li>
  <p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;<b>Additional comments to the program 
  committee<br>
  </b>There may be reasons that influence your rating of the paper that would 
  reveal your identity, or that you would only like made available to the 
  program committee. Please elaborate if there are any such issues; these 
  comments will be held in confidence.</li>
