Version 2.7   23.Aug.2007

* Email notification for comments.  Authors, reviewers, and PC members can
  request email notification when comments are added to a paper they are
  interested in.  The system tracks a global preference and per-paper
  preferences, so one can say "no notifications in general, but notify me
  about paper 4".  Notification is on by default.  Requires schema changes;
  see the file 'Code/updateschema.sql'.

* PC members and reviewers can view a paper's comments before they finish
  their own reviews for that paper.
