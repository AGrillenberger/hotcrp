Please read in detail ALL of the reviews and the authors rebuttal. After
you have done that, please enter a PC grade for the paper. During this
process only PC members will be entering a PC grade. If your grade differs
from other PC members, please send email and discuss the issues over the
next few days to arrive at an agreed upon grade. You can update the grades
as often as you like up until the end of the grading period specified by
the above date.

In addition to entering a PC grade you can enter additional comments for
the program committee and/or authors to see. These may be additional
comments you have after reading the other reviews or the rebuttal, or
additional comments to back up your PC grade. To enter additional comments
click on the paper link, and enter comments at the bottom.

You should only use "Accept, I will Champion this paper" if you are willing
to champion the paper for an accept at the PC meeting. Likewise, you also
should only use "Reject, I will argue against accept" if you are willing to
argue against the paper from being accepted at the PC meeting.

Note, if you are not going to be at the PC meeting, and want to choose an A
or E for the PC grade, make sure you communicate to another PC member your
praises/arguments ( someone else who is also a reviewer of the paper) so
they can express them at the PC meeting.
