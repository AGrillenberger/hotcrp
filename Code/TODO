- 1. We had an author withdraw their paper several weeks after submission.
  As a result, the paper, all its reviews and the review assignments also
  vanished.  And not only that, even though we actually reviewed 176
  papers, the system tells everyone it was only 175 (this means more to me
  than is healthy)!!! Need to restrict this to the chair after the
  submission deadline. [Rebecca Isaacs]

- 2. It would be helpful to store information about reviews outstanding by
  reviewing round eg paper n has 1/3 for the first round and 4/5 for the
  second.  In fact it would also be great to be able to look at paper
  rankings by round to see how things changed.  I would really like stats
  to see the value of multiple reviewing rounds - how much first round
  reviews predict the eventual outcome etc. [Rebecca Isaacs]

- 3. The line endings in the email composition page are messed up for
  me. [Rebecca Isaacs]

- 4. Can you list both authors and institutions in the conflicts page?  And
  for that matter it would be helpful (to the chair at least) if the source
  of conflict was listed, eg requested by author (or PC) vs matching words
  in author list, etc. [Rebecca Isaacs]

- 5. It would be nice to have multiple review forms, in particular to have
  a different form for externals. [Rebecca Isaacs]

- 6. Have you considered functionality so the automatic review assignment
  can take into account nominated reviewers?  Eg so 1st round reviewers can
  suggest 2nd round people through the system and the chair doesn't have to
  do reviewing rearrangements manually. [Rebecca Isaacs]

- Should comments be visible to PC members immediately? [Robbert van Renesse]

- i like the fact that i can see - just based on simple averaging - how
  harsh or liberal a reviewer is. however in defense of harsh reviewers who
  may have obtained genuinely crummy papers and liberal ones who might have
  recd instant-accepts, what might be useful is once all or most of reviews
  are in, looking at the deviation of the 'harsh' reviewer from other
  reviews of the papers he/she reviewed, and likewise for 'liberal reviewer
  and recompute a balanced score. as long as this is available just before
  the PC meeting then during the PC meeting we would know who is a softie
  and who is trying to 'kill' papers. am not sure if this feature exists
  now. [Balachander Krishnamurthy]

- it would be great to infer area/sub-topic expert based on self-rating of
  reviewers in their reviews to see where reviewers are in the cheriton
  scale (1..100, where cheriton is 420). this would help assing conflict
  papers, poorly reviewed papers, last minute papers to such
  reviewers. [Balachander Krishnamurthy]

- comment threading

* From the "Assign reviews manually by PC member" page, you can get to
  "Assign reviews manually by paper," but not vice versa. [Benjamin Pierce]

* When you first create an assignment, you're given a very useful list of
  all the papers and who they're assigned to.  But I can't find any way to
  get back to this list afterward. [Benjamin Pierce]

* Again for tweaking the assignment, it would be really helpful to have a
  *single* global view of the whole assignment, showing all available
  information and allowing papers to be reassigned at will. [Benjamin
  Pierce]

* There should be a bulk *download* option -- this would allow you to save
  away the current assignment and restore it later if you messed things up.
  (This would require the bulk upload feature to be able to delete
  assignments as well as add them -- and/or to be able to say "these are
  exactly the reviewers for this paper".  This would be useful more
  generally.) [Benjamin Pierce]

* When I was stepping through the assignments paper by paper, the "next
  paper" links at the top took me from paper #18 to paper #87 and then to
  paper #19!  Similarly, #119 got sorted between 101 and 102, and there was
  one other instance of the same. [Benjamin Pierce]

* Is there a way to search for all PC-authored papers? [Benjamin Pierce]

* The default invitation letter to external reviewers suggests that they
  don't need to let the requesting PC member know whether or not they can
  do the review.  It seems better to ask them to confirm one way or the
  other.  (Indeed, I think the web site should provide a way for an
  external reviewer to agree to do the review without actually entering
  it.) [Benjamin Pierce]

* How about cc'ing the requesting PC member on the invitation request
  email? [Benjamin Pierce]

* At some point I was trying to request an external review but I mangled
  the email field.  HotCRP just gave me the same page back, with no
  indication that anything had gone wrong except that the review I thought
  I'd just requested didn't appear on the pending list. [Benjamin Pierce]

* When I'm sending mail to people via the website, I want to make sure that
  it's going to be CC'd to me.  It would be helpful if the mail template
  either offered me a field to control who gets messages or -- perhaps
  sufficient -- displayed an un-editable indication that this was going to
  happen automatically. [Benjamin Pierce]

* Similarly, when an external reviewer goes to the website to decline (or
  confirm!) a review, it should be more obvious who will see the
  message. [Benjamin Pierce]

* The Comments section could be a little more self-documenting -- e.g.,
  there could be a note someplace saying that anyone who has written a
  review for a given paper will be notified by default when there are new
  comments.  (Or do I mean: anyone who has written OR IS SIGNED UP TO BE
  WRITING a review for a given paper...?) [Benjamin Pierce]

Please read in detail ALL of the reviews and the authors rebuttal. After
you have done that, please enter a PC grade for the paper. During this
process only PC members will be entering a PC grade. If your grade differs
from other PC members, please send email and discuss the issues over the
next few days to arrive at an agreed upon grade. You can update the grades
as often as you like up until the end of the grading period specified by
the above date.

In addition to entering a PC grade you can enter additional comments for
the program committee and/or authors to see. These may be additional
comments you have after reading the other reviews or the rebuttal, or
additional comments to back up your PC grade. To enter additional comments
click on the paper link, and enter comments at the bottom.

You should only use "Accept, I will Champion this paper" if you are willing
to champion the paper for an accept at the PC meeting. Likewise, you also
should only use "Reject, I will argue against accept" if you are willing to
argue against the paper from being accepted at the PC meeting.

Note, if you are not going to be at the PC meeting, and want to choose an A
or E for the PC grade, make sure you communicate to another PC member your
praises/arguments ( someone else who is also a reviewer of the paper) so
they can express them at the PC meeting.
