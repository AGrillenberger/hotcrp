HotCRP: Conference Review Package 2
===================================

New version by Eddie Kohler, UCLA
CRP originally by Dirk Grunwald, University of Colorado

Prerequisites
-------------
CRP requires the following packages.  Tested versions are in parentheses.

* Apache			http://apache.org/
  (You may be able to use another web server that works with PHP.)
* PHP version 5 or higher	http://php.net/
* MySQL version 5 or higher	http://mysql.org/
* Several PHP PEAR packages:	http://pear.php.net/
  - Mail (1.1.14)		http://pear.php.net/package/Mail
  - Mail_Mime (1.3.1)		http://pear.php.net/package/Mail_Mime

The PHP PEAR packages are currently distributed as part of the CRP tarball.

Configuration
-------------
* Database configuration
  - Decide on a name for your database (no spaces allowed).
  - Run "sudo Code/createdb.sh" to create the database.
  - Edit 'my.cnf' (typical location: '/etc/my.cnf') to ensure that MySQL
    can handle large objects.  In the [mysqld] section, add a line like:
    max_allowed_packet=32M

* Site configuration
  - Edit "Code/options.inc", which is annotated to guide you.
  - Redirect Apache so your server URL will point at the CRP directory.
  - Sign in to the site to create an account.  The first account created
    automatically receives PC chair privilege.

Now you're done, and can set up everything else through the web site
itself.  Chairs should particularly check out the "Advanced search" notes.

* Configuration notes
  - CRP users upload papers and reviews to the CRP web server.  Several PHP
    configuration variables affect the maximum attachment size the server will
    accept.  These variables are set in the base directory's ".htaccess" to
    20 megabytes; you may want to lower them.
  - CRP users are given session cookies, allowing them to use the web site
    for a while (usually 24 hours) before having to sign in again.
    However, on some Debian Linux systems, a system cron job
    garbage-collects old sessions based on the system-wide session
    lifetime, which can be quite short.  On these systems, you will need to
    change the system-wide "session.gc_maxlifetime" setting in /etc/php.ini
    to exceed the desired CRP session lifetime.  This setting is measured
    in seconds, so 86400 corresponds to 24 hours.
  - CRP PHP scripts can take a lot of memory, particularly if they're doing
    things like generating MIME-encoded mail messages.  By default CRP sets
    the PHP memory limit to 128MB.
