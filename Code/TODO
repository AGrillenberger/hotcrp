- make sure that refused reviewers do not get emails on comments

- I had a quick question. I was looking if there is an option in hotcrp
  that I could enable so that TPC members are notified when a new paper has
  been assigned to them, and did not manage to find it. Is this feature
  supported? If not, would it be an easy fix? [Dina Papagiannaki]

- User/Author Agreement: click I Agree [Michael Kaminsky]

- Author response word counting function [Mike Marty]

- It would be great to be able to assign reviews manually, but then ask the
  system to look for swaps that would make both reviewers happier according
  to their preferences. I'd want to be able to confirm one swap at a
  time. [Andrew Myers]

- There seems to be no way to select the set of papers for "Assign, manual
  by PC member".  If you select a set (e.g., tag:short) in Automatic
  assignment, and then select Manual, the selection is forgotten. [John
  Wilkes]

- Visually or in search differentiate external review scores from PC review
  scores [Casey Henderson/Adam Moskowitz].

- string options

- upload multiple documents [Gareth Gale]

- 1. We had an author withdraw their paper several weeks after submission.
  As a result, the paper, all its reviews and the review assignments also
  vanished.  And not only that, even though we actually reviewed 176
  papers, the system tells everyone it was only 175 (this means more to me
  than is healthy)!!! Need to restrict this to the chair after the
  submission deadline. [Rebecca Isaacs]

- 2. It would be helpful to store information about reviews outstanding by
  reviewing round eg paper n has 1/3 for the first round and 4/5 for the
  second.  In fact it would also be great to be able to look at paper
  rankings by round to see how things changed.  I would really like stats
  to see the value of multiple reviewing rounds - how much first round
  reviews predict the eventual outcome etc. [Rebecca Isaacs]

- 3. The line endings in the email composition page are messed up for
  me. [Rebecca Isaacs]

- 4. Can you list both authors and institutions in the conflicts page?  And
  for that matter it would be helpful (to the chair at least) if the source
  of conflict was listed, eg requested by author (or PC) vs matching words
  in author list, etc. [Rebecca Isaacs]

- 5. It would be nice to have multiple review forms, in particular to have
  a different form for externals. [Rebecca Isaacs]

- 6. Have you considered functionality so the automatic review assignment
  can take into account nominated reviewers?  Eg so 1st round reviewers can
  suggest 2nd round people through the system and the chair doesn't have to
  do reviewing rearrangements manually. [Rebecca Isaacs]

- i like the fact that i can see - just based on simple averaging - how
  harsh or liberal a reviewer is. however in defense of harsh reviewers who
  may have obtained genuinely crummy papers and liberal ones who might have
  recd instant-accepts, what might be useful is once all or most of reviews
  are in, looking at the deviation of the 'harsh' reviewer from other
  reviews of the papers he/she reviewed, and likewise for 'liberal reviewer
  and recompute a balanced score. as long as this is available just before
  the PC meeting then during the PC meeting we would know who is a softie
  and who is trying to 'kill' papers. am not sure if this feature exists
  now. [Balachander Krishnamurthy]

- it would be great to infer area/sub-topic expert based on self-rating of
  reviewers in their reviews to see where reviewers are in the cheriton
  scale (1..100, where cheriton is 420). this would help assing conflict
  papers, poorly reviewed papers, last minute papers to such
  reviewers. [Balachander Krishnamurthy]

- comment threading

* From the "Assign reviews manually by PC member" page, you can get to
  "Assign reviews manually by paper," but not vice versa. [Benjamin Pierce]

* Again for tweaking the assignment, it would be really helpful to have a
  *single* global view of the whole assignment, showing all available
  information and allowing papers to be reassigned at will. [Benjamin
  Pierce]

* There should be a bulk *download* option -- this would allow you to save
  away the current assignment and restore it later if you messed things up.
  (This would require the bulk upload feature to be able to delete
  assignments as well as add them -- and/or to be able to say "these are
  exactly the reviewers for this paper".  This would be useful more
  generally.) [Benjamin Pierce]

* How about cc'ing the requesting PC member on the invitation request
  email? [Benjamin Pierce] -- won't cc, but maybe resend mail

- Check that review tokens and external reviewer requests mix

* When I'm sending mail to people via the website, I want to make sure that
  it's going to be CC'd to me.  It would be helpful if the mail template
  either offered me a field to control who gets messages or -- perhaps
  sufficient -- displayed an un-editable indication that this was going to
  happen automatically. [Benjamin Pierce]

* Similarly, when an external reviewer goes to the website to decline (or
  confirm!) a review, it should be more obvious who will see the
  message. [Benjamin Pierce]

* The Comments section could be a little more self-documenting -- e.g.,
  there could be a note someplace saying that anyone who has written a
  review for a given paper will be notified by default when there are new
  comments.  (Or do I mean: anyone who has written OR IS SIGNED UP TO BE
  WRITING a review for a given paper...?) [Benjamin Pierce]

* As a PC member, I might be interested in discussions even if I am not a
  reviewer who is emailed a comment by default.  It would be nice if we
  could search on "commented after 7/23" or display and sort on things like
  the number of comments and the last time a comment was entered. [Fred
  Douglis]

* It would be nice if the chair email generated when a review is updated
  included a diff.  (Otherwise is it usually close to impossible to figure
  out what changed.)  I would use this a lot, because I try to read all the
  reviews as they come in, to track how everything is going. [Benjamin
  Pierce]

* Is there a way for me to sign up to see comments that are entered on
  every paper whatsoever?  (Or does this already happen for the PC chair?)
  [Benjamin Pierce]

* Meta-comment: One problem with several areas of HotCRP's interface is
  that, although it is doing something reasonable, it is hard for users to
  see or predict what it is doing.  This could be corrected by writing a
  longer manual, of course, but I think it's probably more useful to find
  ways of adding little snippets of text here and there that give better
  hints of what is going to happen.  (If the snippets start getting too
  cluttered, there could be a way to disable them selectively.) [Benjamin
  Pierce]

* But maybe instead of sending a literal CC, the PC member could be sent a
  redacted copy [of the external review request] with the password blanked
  out? [Benjamin Pierce]

* Mainly that the PC member can't see the wording of the request -- it
  feels like shooting blind.  (More concretely, they can't see, for
  example, what deadline the subreviewers are being given.)  Also, it means
  that they don't have a copy of the email in their files, so they can't do
  things like forward it with "PING" added to the subject line... :-)
  [Benjamin Pierce]

* Clarify on paper submission page the difference between authors and
  contact authors.  We had some papers that didn't list some of the contact
  authors as authors. [Mark Gebhart, MICRO 41]

* Ability to search accepted papers for those that have / have not
  submitted final copies of their paper [Mark Gebhart, MICRO 41]

* Include an option to have both a soft and hard deadline for the
  collection of final papers. [Mark Gebhart, MICRO 41]

* Here are some policy decisions that we changed by editing the code:

  Ability to prevent reviewers from seeing other reviews of papers they
  reviewed until shortly before PC meeting [Mark Gebhart, MICRO 41]

  Ability to show reviews to authors without showing comments to
  authors.  We had some PC comments that were entered before the PC
  meeting that we didn't want to expose until after decisions had been
  made. [Mark Gebhart, MICRO 41]

  Not allow PC members to see anything about papers they didn't review
  until PC meeting [Mark Gebhart, MICRO 41]

  Allow PC members to view a paper's manuscript if they can view any
  information about a paper [Mark Gebhart, MICRO 41]

* At the hotel where the PC meeting was held it was not possible to provide
  internet access to PC members.  To allow PC members to view content
  during the meeting we used wget to spider the submission site a couple of
  days before the meeting as each member and burned a custom cd for each PC
  member.  We had to make quite a few code changes to create a version of
  the site to spider that would not generate an large number of pages.  We
  removed the ability to search and anything else that would depend on
  generating dynamic content.  The resulting spidered webpages were around
  100mb per PC member.  This seemed to work very well for the meeting and
  we didn't have any trouble with people accessing their files on their
  machines.  We found this to be quite useful and while it involved a fair
  amount of work the ability to turn off all of the dynamic content with a
  setting or flag in the code would be a great addition.  We realize this
  may not be easy to do. [Mark Gebhart, MICRO 41]

* It would be really useful to be able to turn off sending emails about
  comments to anyone outside of the PC.  During the PC meeting, they
  naturally get used for all sorts of tasks like communicating final
  suggestions to the authors that reveal too much (e.g., the current
  acceptance state) to the outside reviewers.  (I guess this can actually
  be achieved with settings already available -- right?  So maybe this is a
  documentation issue...) [Benjamin Pierce]

* It would be nice if there were some mechanism for preventing misspelling
  of tag names when new tags are added.  E.g., when a new tag is added,
  there could be a little extra confirmation dialog asking whether you want
  to add that tag. [Benjamin Pierce]

* For the sake of paranoia, it would be very nice to be able to make a
  *complete* textual dump of all information about all papers -- reviews,
  comments, scores, tags, decisions, etc.  I was sweating the whole weekend
  wondering what we'd do if the network went down. [Benjamin Pierce]

* it would be cute to have 1 config of hotcrp so that PC members get given
  as many scores drawn from a normal distribution as they have papers, and
  then can only use each score once. [Jon Crowcroft]

* Someone on the NSDI noted that they encountered a race between their
  (somewhat tedious) filling out of their review preferences (i.e.,
  assigning integer values to each submitted paper) and the PC chair's
  use of the auto-assigner.

  So PC member X starts a lengthy process of filling in his prefs, then
  discovers that sometime in the middle of this, HotCRP has captured his
  preferences to that point and has ignored the rest of his work.

  Suggestion: have the reviewprefs page somehow indicate to the user
  (perhaps by changing the background color to something lurid?) that
  the reviews have already been assigned. [Jeff Mogul]

* Do not log updates to reviews made using chair power, if those reviews
  are explicitly anonymous. [John Wilkes]

2. [possible defect] When looking at possible conflicts for a paper using
  "search for potential conflicts" on "Assign papers - manual by PC
  member", the set of "reviews to be done" doesn't seem to be that of the
  selected PC member.  I can't quite work out what it is - I thought at
  first that it was the viewer's list, but it seems to change if the PC
  member changes, so I'm not quite sure what's going on. [John Wilkes]

3. Having to hit "Go" on the "Change PC member" proved a fruitful source of
  user-errors - we kept on forgetting to push the go button.  Please can it
  just happen automagically? [John Wilkes]

4. It's somewhat of tedious to flip back and forth between per-paper and
  per-PC member review assignments.  Could some better navigation shortcuts
  be made available? [John Wilkes]

Multi-round assignment process.  Doing this showed up a couple of issues:

5. On the automatic assignments page, there's an option to specify "Don't
  assign PC member 1 and 2 to the same paper."  That has to be re-entered
  each time - it's not sticky, whereas I think it should be. [John Wilkes]

6. It would also be nice to be able to specify a simple list, rather than
  having to provide everything as pairwise restrictions.  (We had a clump
  of 4 people, which turned into a lot of separate rules of this form.)
  [John Wilkes]

8. Review types.  HotCRP has the notion of primary and secondary reviews.
  Great!  But their meanings seem to be hard-wired.  We wanted to use them
  for "full" and "light" - which is what we did, but we then had to
  admonish the PC to not get confused by the labels.  Better would be to
  offer a set of labels, with the current ones as defaults. [John Wilkes]

9. Reviewing load. We also wanted to assign our own weights to different
  review types when doing the load balancing.  (For us, a light review was
  worth half as much as a full one.)  In the end, Joe wrote an SQL query to
  calculate the weights, and we used the multi-round assignment process to
  roughly balance the loads. [John Wilkes]

10. Conflict checking

    * The list of names/words to ignore could usefully be both longer
  (e.g., add "Labs" and "research" to the list), and settable by the PC
  chair.

    * Conflicts of the form "username (affiliation)" leads to entire
  "affiliation" getting marked as a conflict, which seems overkill.  Or was
  that the intent?  The help text seems to suggest not. [John Wilkes]

Format checker: This worked really nicely.  But ...

11. It would be really helpful to be able to state "x% overage is OK" for
  the format checker, rather than editing the individual settings by hand,
  which tended to confuse people about what the real rules were. [John
  Wilkes]

12. It would also be nice to be able to say "we need either A4 or US paper"
  - at moment, you cannot. [John Wilkes]

* it would be nice if there was an easy way to send email from one of a
  paper's pages to the author(s) or reviewers.  As it is, it seems I have
  to go back to the home page, select Send Mail, select "Choose individual
  papers" and type in the paper number.

  Instead, how about a "send email about this paper" link on the "paper"
  page/tab which took me to the "send email" page with those values filled
  in?  This is low priority in comparison to my previous request :-). [John
  Wilkes]

2. The choice(s) for autoassign discussion lead I was given were rather
  limited:

    * Assign discussion lead from reviewers, preferring high scores

  It would be nice to have some other alternatives .. ."preferring low
  scores" is popular; "preferring primary reviewers" is another,
  "preferring knowledgeable" is also good. [John Wilkes]

4. The "manual by PC member" page gives no indication of discussion
  leads. [John Wilkes]

Please read in detail ALL of the reviews and the authors rebuttal. After
you have done that, please enter a PC grade for the paper. During this
process only PC members will be entering a PC grade. If your grade differs
from other PC members, please send email and discuss the issues over the
next few days to arrive at an agreed upon grade. You can update the grades
as often as you like up until the end of the grading period specified by
the above date.

In addition to entering a PC grade you can enter additional comments for
the program committee and/or authors to see. These may be additional
comments you have after reading the other reviews or the rebuttal, or
additional comments to back up your PC grade. To enter additional comments
click on the paper link, and enter comments at the bottom.

You should only use "Accept, I will Champion this paper" if you are willing
to champion the paper for an accept at the PC meeting. Likewise, you also
should only use "Reject, I will argue against accept" if you are willing to
argue against the paper from being accepted at the PC meeting.

Note, if you are not going to be at the PC meeting, and want to choose an A
or E for the PC grade, make sure you communicate to another PC member your
praises/arguments ( someone else who is also a reviewer of the paper) so
they can express them at the PC meeting.
