HotCRP: Conference Review Package 2.34
======================================

New version by Eddie Kohler, UCLA
CRP originally by Dirk Grunwald, University of Colorado
banal by Geoff Voelker, UCSD

Prerequisites
-------------
HotCRP requires the following software.  Tested versions are in parentheses.

* Apache			http://apache.org/
  (You may be able to use another web server that works with PHP.)
* PHP version 5 or higher	http://php.net/
  - Including MySQL and GD support
  - PHP 5.2 or higher recommended
* MySQL version 5 or higher	http://mysql.org/
* PHP PEAR extensions		http://pear.php.net/

Apache is preloaded on most Linux distributions.  You may need to install
additional packages for PHP, MySQL, GD, and PEAR, such as:

* Fedora Linux: php-mysql, php-pear, php-gd
* Debian Linux: php5-common, php5-gd, php5-mysql, php-pear, 
  libapache2-mod-php5 (or libapache-mod-php5 for Apache 1.x)
* Ubuntu Linux: php5-common, php5-gd, php5-mysql, php-pear,
  libapache2-mod-php5 (or libapache-mod-php5 for Apache 1.x), and a package
  for SMTP support, such as postfix

You may need to restart the Apache web server after installing these
packages ("sudo apachectl graceful" or "sudo apache2ctl graceful").

Versions of the Mail and Mail_Mime PHP PEAR packages are currently
distributed as part of the HotCRP tarball (Mail 1.1.14, Mail_Mime 1.4.0).

Additional packages required for paper format checking:

* pdftohtml (0.39 or 0.36)	http://pdftohtml.sourceforge.net/

Warning: The pdftohtml package has had several bugs that affect HotCRP.
Version 0.40a is radically slower than other versions.  Version 0.39 is
currently the best choice for HotCRP -- reported font sizes will be more
precise than is possible with version 0.36.  Test paper format checking in
your environment; if it reports incorrect results or takes too long,
disable it.

Load notes: HotCRP requires a system with at least 256MB of memory, more if
paper format checking is used and submission load is expected to be high.
If you run HotCRP in a virtual machine, make sure you configure suitable
swap space!  If MySQL is killed due to memory shortages your database may
be corrupted.


Configuration
-------------
* Database configuration

  - Decide on a name for your database (no spaces allowed).

  - If you checked HotCRP out from CVS, remove the "Code/options.inc" file.

  - Run "sudo Code/createdb.sh" to create the database.  You may also run
    "sudo Code/createdb.sh OPTIONS" to pass options to MySQL, such as
    --user and --password.  Run "Code/createdb.sh --help" for more
    information.

* Site configuration

  - Edit "Code/options.inc", which is annotated to guide you.
    ("Code/createdb.sh" creates this file based on "Code/distoptions.inc".)

  - Redirect Apache so your server URL will point at the HotCRP directory.
    (If you get an Error 500, see "Configuration notes".)  This will
    generally require adding a <Directory> for the HotCRP directory, and an
    Alias redirecting a particular URL to that directory.  For example,
    this section of httpd.conf makes the "/testconf" URL point at a HotCRP
    installation in /home/kohler/hotcrp.

	<Directory "/home/kohler/hotcrp">
	        Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
	        AllowOverride all
	        Order allow,deny
	        Allow from all
	</Directory>
	Alias /testconf /home/kohler/hotcrp

    Note that the first argument to Alias should NOT end in a slash.  The
    "AllowOverride all" directive is required.

  - Update the systemwide setting for PHP's 'session.gc_maxlifetime'
    configuration variable.  This provides an upper bound on HotCRP session
    lifetimes (the amount of idle time before a user is logged out
    automatically).  On Unix machines, systemwide PHP settings are often
    stored in '/etc/php.ini'.  The suggested value for this setting is
    86400, e.g., 24 hours:

	session.gc_maxlifetime = 86400

    If you want sessions to expire sooner, we recommend you set
    'session.gc_maxlifetime' to 86400 anyway, then edit Code/options.inc to
    set '$Opt["sessionLifetime"]' to the correct session timeout.

  - Edit MySQL's 'my.cnf' (typical location: '/etc/my.cnf') to ensure that
    MySQL can handle paper-sized objects.  It should contain something like
    this:

       [mysqld]
       max_allowed_packet=32M

    max_allowed_packet must be at least as large as the largest paper you
    are willing to accept.  It defaults to 1M on some systems, which is not
    nearly large enough.  HotCRP will warn you if it is too small.  Some
    MySQL setups, such as on Mac OS X, may not have a 'my.cnf' by default;
    just create one.  If you edit my.cnf, also restart the mysqld server.
    On Linux boxes "sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld restart" often suffices.

  - Sign in to the site to create an account.  The first account created
    automatically receives system administrator privilege.

    If your server configuration doesn't allow .htaccess files to set
    options, Apache will report an "Error 500" when you try to load HotCRP.
    Change your Apache configuration to "AllowOverride All" in the HotCRP
    directory, as our example does above.

    If your server shows you a directory listing rather than the HotCRP
    homepage, add the following line to the <Directory>:

	        DirectoryIndex index.html index.php

  - You can set up everything else through the web site itself.

* Configuration notes

  - Uploaded papers and reviews are limited in size by several PHP
    configuration variables, set by default to 20 megabytes in the base
    directory's ".htaccess".  You may want to lower them.

  - HotCRP PHP scripts can take a lot of memory, particularly if they're
    doing things like generating MIME-encoded mail messages.  By default
    HotCRP sets the PHP memory limit to 128MB.

  - HotCRP uses Apache's mod_expires module; consider enabling it.


Backing up the database
-----------------------
Run "Code/backupdb.sh" at the shell prompt to back up the database.  This
will write the database's current structure and comments to the standard
output.


Updating the code
-----------------
HotCRP code can be updated without updating the database schema.  Simply
copy the new version over your old code, preserving Code/options.inc.  For
instance, using GNU tar:

   % cd HOTCRPINSTALLATION
   % tar --strip=1 -xzf ~/hotcrp-VERSIONNUMBER.tar.gz

The next time someone uses the site the schema should automatically be
upgraded.  See "Code/updateschema.inc".


Multiconference support
-----------------------
HotCRP has preliminary support for running multiple conferences out of a
single installation.  Edit options.inc to set $Opt["multiconference"] to 1.
The last directory component of the URL is used for the database name,
user, and password.  For instance:

   http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/conferences/testconf/doc/testconf-paper1.pdf
                                           ^^^^^^^^
                                   last directory component

Alternately, you may set $Opt["dbName"], $Opt["dbUser"],
$Opt["dbPassword"], and so forth.  HotCRP will edit each of those settings
to replace the "*" character with the last directory component.  (This
replacement is also performed on the sessionName, downloadPrefix,
conferenceSite, and paperSite options.)

You will still need to create a new database for each conference using the
"Code/createdb.sh" script.  Note that the "Code/backupdb.sh" script doesn't
work for multiconference installations, and that several important options,
such as contactName and contactEmail, cannot yet be set using the web
interface.
