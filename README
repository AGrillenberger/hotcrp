HotCRP: Conference Review Package 2
===================================

New version by Eddie Kohler, UCLA
CRP originally by Dirk Grunwald, University of Colorado

Prerequisites
-------------
HotCRP requires the following packages.  Tested versions are in parentheses.

* Apache			http://apache.org/
  (You may be able to use another web server that works with PHP.)
* PHP version 5 or higher	http://php.net/
* MySQL version 5 or higher	http://mysql.org/
* Several PHP PEAR packages:	http://pear.php.net/
  - Mail (1.1.14)		http://pear.php.net/package/Mail
  - Mail_Mime (1.3.1)		http://pear.php.net/package/Mail_Mime

The PHP PEAR packages are currently distributed as part of the HotCRP tarball.

Configuration
-------------
* Database configuration
  - Decide on a name for your database (no spaces allowed).
  - Run "sudo Code/createdb.sh" to create the database.
  - Edit 'my.cnf' (typical location: '/etc/my.cnf') to ensure that MySQL
    can handle large objects.  In the [mysqld] section, add a line like:
    max_allowed_packet=32M

* Site configuration
  - Edit "Code/options.inc", which is annotated to guide you.
  - Redirect Apache so your server URL will point at the HotCRP directory.
    (If you get an Error 500, see "Configuration notes".)
  - Sign in to the site to create an account.  The first account created
    automatically receives PC chair privilege.

Now you're done, and can set up everything else through the web site
itself.  Chairs should particularly check out the "Advanced search" notes.

* Configuration notes
  - HotCRP's .htaccess files set various PHP options.  If your server
    configuration doesn't allow .htaccess files to set options, Apache will
    report an "Error 500" when you try to load HotCRP.  Change your Apache
    configuration to "AllowOverride All" in the HotCRP directory.
  - HotCRP users upload papers and reviews to the HotCRP web server.  Several 
    PHP configuration variables affect the maximum attachment size the server
    will accept.  These variables are set in the base directory's ".htaccess"
    to 20 megabytes; you may want to lower them.
  - HotCRP users are given session cookies, allowing them to use the web site
    for a while (usually 24 hours) before having to sign in again.
    However, on some Debian Linux systems, a system cron job
    garbage-collects old sessions based on the system-wide session
    lifetime, which can be quite short.  On these systems, you will need to
    change the system-wide "session.gc_maxlifetime" setting in /etc/php.ini
    to exceed the desired HotCRP session lifetime.  This setting is measured
    in seconds, so 86400 corresponds to 24 hours.
  - HotCRP PHP scripts can take a lot of memory, particularly if they're
    doing things like generating MIME-encoded mail messages.  By default
    HotCRP sets the PHP memory limit to 128MB.
