HotCRP: Conference Review Package 2.17
======================================

New version by Eddie Kohler, UCLA
CRP originally by Dirk Grunwald, University of Colorado
banal by Geoff Voelker, UCSD

Prerequisites
-------------
HotCRP requires the following software.  Tested versions are in parentheses.

* Apache			http://apache.org/
  (You may be able to use another web server that works with PHP.)
* PHP version 5 or higher	http://php.net/
  - Including support for MySQL, GD, and PEAR
* MySQL version 5 or higher	http://mysql.org/
* Several PHP PEAR packages:	http://pear.php.net/
  - Mail (1.1.14)		http://pear.php.net/package/Mail
  - Mail_Mime (1.4.0)		http://pear.php.net/package/Mail_Mime

The Mail and Mail_Mime PEAR packages are currently distributed as part of
the HotCRP tarball.  You may need to install additional packages to enable
PHP's MySQL, GD, and PEAR support.  On Fedora, the "php-mysql", "php-pear",
and "php-gd" packages are required.  On Debian, you will need
"php5-common", "php5-gd", "php5-mysql", and "libapache2-mod-php5" (or
"libapache-mod-php5" if you are using Apache 1.x).  On Ubuntu, you will
need the Debian packages as well as a package for SMTP support, such as
"postfix".

Additional packages required for paper format checking:
* pdftohtml (0.39)		http://pdftohtml.sourceforge.net/

Load notes: HotCRP should be run on a system with at least 256MB of memory,
more if paper format checking is used and submission load is expected to be
high.  If you run HotCRP in a virtual machine, make sure you configure
suitable swap space!  If MySQL is killed due to memory shortages it may
corrupt your database.


Configuration
-------------
* Database configuration

  - Decide on a name for your database (no spaces allowed).

  - If you checked HotCRP out from CVS, remove the "Code/options.inc" file.

  - Run "sudo Code/createdb.sh" to create the database.  You may also run
    "sudo Code/createdb.sh OPTIONS" to pass options to MySQL, such as
    --user and --password.  Run "Code/createdb.sh --help" for more
    information.

  - Edit 'my.cnf' (typical location: '/etc/my.cnf') to ensure that MySQL
    can handle large objects.  It should contain something like this:

	[mysqld]
	max_allowed_packet=32M

    If you are accepting very large papers, make max_allowed_packet even
    larger.  Some MySQL setups, such as on Mac OS X, may not have a
    'my.cnf' by default; just create one.  If you need to edit my.cnf, you
    must restart the mysqld server; on Linux boxes "sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld
    restart" often suffices.

* Site configuration

  - Edit "Code/options.inc", which is annotated to guide you.
    ("Code/createdb.sh" creates this file based on "Code/distoptions.inc".)

  - Redirect Apache so your server URL will point at the HotCRP directory.
    (If you get an Error 500, see "Configuration notes".)  This will
    generally require adding a <Directory> for the HotCRP directory, and an
    Alias redirecting a particular URL to that directory.  For example,
    this section of httpd.conf makes the "/testconf" URL point at a HotCRP
    installation in /home/kohler/testconf-crp.

	<Directory "/home/kohler/testconf-crp">
	        Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
	        AllowOverride all
	        Order allow,deny
	        Allow from all
	</Directory>
	Alias /testconf /home/kohler/hotnets-crp

    Note that the first argument to Alias should NOT end in a slash.  The
    "AllowOverride all" directive is required.

  - Update the systemwide setting for PHP's 'session.gc_maxlifetime'
    configuration variable.  This provides an upper bound on HotCRP session
    lifetimes (the amount of idle time before a user is logged out
    automatically).  On Unix machines, systemwide PHP settings are often
    stored in '/etc/php.ini'.  The suggested value for this setting is
    86400, e.g., 24 hours:

	session.gc_maxlifetime = 86400

    If you want sessions to expire sooner, we recommend you set
    'session.gc_maxlifetime' to 86400 anyway, then edit Code/options.inc to
    set '$Opt["sessionLifetime"]' to the correct session timeout.

  - Sign in to the site to create an account.  The first account created
    automatically receives PC chair privilege.

    If your server configuration doesn't allow .htaccess files to set
    options, Apache will report an "Error 500" when you try to load HotCRP.
    Change your Apache configuration to "AllowOverride All" in the HotCRP
    directory, as our example does above.

    If your server shows you a directory listing rather than the HotCRP
    homepage, add the following line to the <Directory>:

	        DirectoryIndex index.html index.php

  - You can set up everything else through the web site itself.

* Configuration notes

  - Uploaded papers and reviews are limited in size by several PHP
    configuration variables, set by default to 20 megabytes in the base
    directory's ".htaccess".  You may want to lower them.

  - HotCRP PHP scripts can take a lot of memory, particularly if they're
    doing things like generating MIME-encoded mail messages.  By default
    HotCRP sets the PHP memory limit to 128MB.

  - HotCRP uses Apache's mod_expires module; consider enabling it.


Backing up the database
-----------------------
Run "Code/backupdb.sh" at the shell prompt to back up the database.  This
will write the database's current structure and comments to the standard
output.


Updating the code
-----------------
HotCRP is designed so that you can update the code without updating the
database schema.  Simply copy the new version over your old code,
preserving your old Code/options.inc.  The next time someone uses the site
the schema should automatically be upgraded.  See "Code/updateschema.inc".
